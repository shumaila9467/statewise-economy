    <div class="subtitle">
        An interactive exploration of industry earnings, state-level trends, and economic growth dynamics across the United States.

        <h2>1. State-wise Earnings by Industry and Year</h2>

        <p>
            This visualization compares industry earnings across all U.S. states for a selected year.
            Using the dropdown menus inside the chart, you can filter states and years to explore how
            each industry contributes to the local economy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Try selecting <strong>Mining &amp; Oil/Gas</strong> — it’s nearly invisible in many states but
            becomes the largest sector in energy-heavy states like Texas.
        </p>

            <strong>Note:</strong> A zero in the dataset may represent missing or suppressed data rather
            than an actual value of zero.
