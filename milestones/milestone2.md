## Goal

My current goal is to build an interactive web-based economic dashboard that helps users explore how different industries contribute to each U.S. state's economy, and how these patterns evolve over time.

The dashboard includes:

State-wise Industry Earnings (Bar Chart)

Year-over-Year Industry Growth Trends (Line Chart, 2019–2024)

Horizontal Industry Comparison within a State (Bar Chart)

These views allow users to examine both static and dynamic aspects of state-level economic structure.

Originally, my proposal planned to integrate socioeconomic variables from USDA ERS (education, unemployment, population).

I refined my scope to focus solely on BEA’s GDP by Industry dataset, enabling a cleaner and more cohesive economic exploration.


## Data Challenges

No data challenges 

## Walk Through

1. Landing Page

The user opens the webpage and sees a clean, economics-themed layout with three visualizations arranged in sections.

2. Visualization 1 — State-wise Industry Earnings

The user chooses a state and a year from dropdown menus.

The bar chart updates to show the earnings of all industries in that state.

This gives a quick overview of the state’s economic structure.

Visualization 2 — Horizontal Industry Comparison

The user picks a state and a year.

The horizontal bar chart updates to compare all industries side-by-side.

This makes it easy to see which industries dominate the state’s economy.

3. Visualization 3 — Growth Trends (2019–2024)

The user selects a state and an industry.

The line chart updates to show year-over-year growth from 2019 to 2024.

This helps the user see whether the industry is growing, declining, or recovering.

## Questions

{Numbered list of questions for course staff, if any.}

1. Is embedding Altair charts via exported .html files and <iframe> acceptable for Option B?

2. Does the narrative accompanying each visualization provide sufficient context, or should I add more economic interpretation?

3. Should I add more years or 5 years sufficient?

4. Is the level of interactivity in my current dashboard sufficient for Option B, or should I incorporate additional interactive elements ?
